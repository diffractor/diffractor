# Upgrade a vendored dependency

Owning document: [third-party](../../docs/third-party.md).

Ask which dependency and which target version if not already stated.

1. **Never edit `third-party/`.** Everything Diffractor owns about a dependency is in
   `cmake/vendored`, the CMake dependency and policy files, or the owned wrapper — the `files_*`
   decoder, [av_format.cpp](../../src/av_format.cpp), [metadata_xmp.cpp](../../src/metadata_xmp.cpp),
   [util_spell.cpp](../../src/util_spell.cpp) or [util_zip.cpp](../../src/util_zip.cpp). If a fix
   seems to require editing vendored source, it belongs in the wrapper or the build configuration.

2. **Inventory the integration patches first.** Read [third-party.md](../../docs/third-party.md) for
   this dependency and list every patch, why it exists, and the test that catches its loss. Several
   are invisible until one specific test fails — that is the point of the list, and it is the thing
   a rebase silently drops.

3. **Rebase, then re-apply.** For FFmpeg, the configuration is compared by
   `tools/compare_ffmpeg_config.py`, which CI runs. The guard is not "no divergence" but "no
   divergence that has not been accounted for": record any new platform switch beside the fork.

4. **Prove it through the wrapper, not the library.** The library's own suite says nothing about
   Diffractor's integration. Run `/test:*metadata*`, `/test:*video*`, `/test:*audio*` and the format
   tests in [test_files.cpp](../../src/test_files.cpp), plus anything the patch list named.

5. **Update the document.** Record the new version, any patch that changed shape, and any patch that
   is no longer needed because upstream took it.

6. **Full validation**, because a dependency change has no narrow blast radius:

   ```powershell
   .\dd.ps1 test
   ```

Report: the version moved from and to, each patch re-applied or retired, the tests run, and anything
you could not verify — an ARM64 or Linux path you did not build is worth saying out loud.
