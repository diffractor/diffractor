# Purpose: Build the vendored FFmpeg fork by driving its own configure and make, and expose the
# five libraries av_format.cpp uses as diffractor::ffmpeg. FFmpeg's build system is the only
# supported way to configure it; restating it in CMake would be a second source of truth for which
# codecs exist.

# This fork is stripped: --disable-postproc, --disable-shared and --enable-static are not options it
# offers. --disable-autodetect keeps the result independent of whatever happens to be installed on
# the build machine, at the price of having to name everything wanted.
#
# zlib is named back because --disable-autodetect had silently taken it, and with it the thirty-odd
# decoders that depend on it -- APNG, EXR, TSCC, ZMBV and the screen-capture family are all present
# in the checked-in Windows config and were absent here.
#
# --disable-network to match the Windows config, which has never had it. Nothing in a local media
# organizer opens a socket, and it removes the RTP, RTSP, SAP and SDP demuxers from the attack
# surface along with the protocol layer beneath them.
#
# Diffractor is a broad-support reader: every decoder and demuxer is wanted, and nothing that writes
# a media stream is. The encoder, muxer, filter, device and protocol switches below are the Windows
# configure line from docs/third-party.md, which this had not been matching -- the whole encoder and
# muxer set was being compiled in here. avif is the one intentional muxer, and file the one
# intentional protocol.
