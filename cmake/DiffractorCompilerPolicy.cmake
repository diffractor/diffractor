# Purpose: The compiler and linker policy for every target, application and vendored alike. It is
# stated once here rather than per target so that "are the flags right" is one file to review.
#
# The MSVC half began as a transcription of src/app.vcxproj, annotated with the project setting
# each flag came from. That project is deleted, so this file is now the only record of it: nothing
# here is guesswork, anything that could not be traced to a setting was left out rather than
# invented, and what was traced and deliberately dropped is in tools/build-divergence.txt.
