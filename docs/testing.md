# Diffractor Testing

This document owns the test taxonomy: which subject owns which test, where a new test belongs, and what the suite is allowed to assume. It does not restate build commands, which belong to [implementation](implementation.md#build-and-validation).

## The suite

Tests are compiled into the application and run from the command line. There is no separate test binary and no external framework.

```powershell
.\dd.ps1 test                              # unit tests + .po validation + translation check
.\exe\diffractor64-d.exe /test             # x64 Debug, everything
.\exe\diffractor64-d.exe /test:*search*    # one subject
.\exe\diffractor64-d.exe "/test:Should rename file case"
```

`/test:` takes a wildcard matched against the test name, case-insensitively. A filter that matches nothing is a failure, not a silent pass.

Release registers exactly six more tests than Debug: five decoder fuzz sweeps and the closest-location lookup are `#ifndef _DEBUG`. Debug `N` and Release `N + 6` is correct; any other gap means something was skipped.

## Taxonomy

One file per subject, matching the `src/` prefixes in [implementation](implementation.md#source-organization). A test lives with the code it constrains, never with the reason it was written.

| [test_platform_win.cpp](../src/test_platform_win.cpp) | `register_platform_tests` | `platform_win*`: extended paths, DXGI device loss, the font stack, the registry store, the shell data object, control painting. The only file that may include system headers |

[test.h](../src/test.h) holds the assertion helpers, [test_fixtures.h](../src/test_fixtures.h) / [test_fixtures.cpp](../src/test_fixtures.cpp) the shared fixtures, and [test_runner.cpp](../src/test_runner.cpp) the console runner. None of them contains a test.

### Placing a test

Ask what the test constrains, not what prompted it.

- A regression goes in the file that owns the behavior, with the issue recorded as a comment above its registration: `// Issue #177 - search term negation`. There is no regressions file. Organizing by provenance means a subject-scoped run silently misses coverage, which is exactly what happened before 2026-08.
- A test that needs two subjects belongs to the one whose contract it would falsify. A metadata value read through the AV probe is a metadata test; the probe's byte budget is an AV test.
- A helper used by tests in one file stays `static` in that file. A helper used from two files moves to `test_fixtures.h` as `inline`.

## What the runner enforces

- **A test that asserts nothing fails.** Assertions are counted per test, so a test disabled by an early return or an `#if` cannot report PASS forever.
- **A duplicate test name fails.** Two registrations under one name make `/test:<name>` ambiguous and a failure report unattributable.
- **A filter matching no test fails.** Silence used to mean the filter missed, not that the tests passed.
- Failures are reported with the source file and line of the failing assertion.

## What a test must not do

- **Persist user state.** A test that appends to a real dictionary, settings key or collection passes once and then fails, and it edits a file the user owns. Write to `_temps` instead.
- **Depend on another test.** Tests share one `shared_test_context` for the loaded index and gazetteer, because loading those per test is not affordable, but nothing else may carry between them.
- **Depend on ordering, wall-clock timing, or the machine's fonts and DPI.** Layout tests measure through a stub measure context for this reason.
- **Add files to `exe/test`.** That folder is indexed recursively and its file count is asserted by `expected_cached_item_count` and by every search-count test. Fixtures loaded directly by path go in `exe/test/excluded1`, which indexing skips.

## Proving a test is worth having

A test that cannot fail is worse than no test, because it reports coverage that does not exist. Before adding one, break the behavior it targets, confirm the test fails, then restore. Record the negative case in the test's comment where it is not obvious.

Two current examples: `Should leave colour unchanged when neutral` asserts the residual is *unbiased*, not merely bounded, because a bound alone cannot see truncation — truncating in `adjust_color` costs at most one level but costs it in the same direction on every pixel. `Should area downscale packed surfaces` compares the AVX2 and SSE2 paths byte for byte, which is what proves the AVX2 path is live at all.

## Fixtures

`exe/test` is the indexed collection every index and search test resolves against; its item count is fixed. `exe/test/excluded1` and `excluded2` are excluded from indexing and hold fixtures loaded by path. Temporary files come from `_temps`, which deletes them at the end of the run; `/test-temp:<path>` redirects them so the write path can be exercised against a network share.

The gazetteer is loaded once per run and shared, because a 24 MB index per test context is not affordable.

## Testing behavior without a window

`view_state` runs headless. Construct it with `null_state_strategy`, `null_async_strategy` and a **null** `view_host_base_ptr`, open a search over the fixture collection, and drive the same entry points the commands do. `browsing_fixture` in [test_app.cpp](../src/test_app.cpp) does exactly this, and it is how selection, filtering, grouping, sibling navigation and the browsing sequence are covered.

Where a decision is trapped inside a method that also performs it, extract the decision rather than building a window. Four rules are pure functions for this reason, and each is worth more than the code it replaced:

| Function | Owns |
|---|---|
| `should_resume_at` / `position_to_save` ([av_player.h](../src/av_player.h)) | the resume window and what a close saves |
| `calc_playback_advance` ([util_interfaces.h](../src/util_interfaces.h)) | slideshow, repeat and continue-with-next, and how they interact |
| `search_edit_session` ([app_search.h](../src/app_search.h)) | the address box editing session: draft, preview, two-stage Escape, Tab, Enter |
| `make_search_auto_complete` ([app_search.h](../src/app_search.h)) | the address bar's completion results: content, ranking, de-duplication, the cap, latest-wins |
| `default_keyboard_accelerators` ([app_commands.h](../src/app_commands.h)) | the shipped key bindings, so a collision can be seen |

A test that drives the completion strategy must run the pass on a real worker thread: `index_state::auto_complete_words` asserts it is not on the UI thread, which is the contract the shipped code keeps. `run_completion_worker` in [test_app.cpp](../src/test_app.cpp) models the hop with a `deferred_async_strategy`; running it inline trips the assertion rather than passing. That is also what makes the latest-wins test possible, because it can publish two passes out of order.

## Known gaps

Recorded so they are not rediscovered as surprises:

- `app_dup_report.cpp` is a read-only diagnostic whose logic lives entirely in an anonymous namespace; it mirrors the index's union-find rather than owning behavior.
- `ui_dialog.h`, `ui_text_view.h` and `ui_plasma.h` have no coverage. The suite has no `ui::draw_context`, so anything whose only output is pixels on a real device is verified by eye.
- View-level behavior for `view_locate`, `view_tags`, `view_batch`, `view_items` and `view_media` is covered only through their planning helpers.
- Nothing drives `view_state::tick` end to end; `calc_playback_advance` covers the decision, not the player calls around it.
- Maker note decoding is exercised only on Canon. The other makes libexif handles reach the same call, but no fixture carries one.
- No fixture holds an embedded image that fails to decode, so the pane's fall back from a picture to a hex dump is proven by construction rather than end to end.
- `parse_mpf_index` in [files_jpeg.cpp](../src/files_jpeg.cpp) is file-static, so its bounds guard against a malformed Multi-Picture index has no test. It parses untrusted file offsets, which is exactly where a silent regression would matter.
- `metadata_tree_control` in [view_items.cpp](../src/view_items.cpp) is file-static and lays out its own detail rows, so nothing covers the box each detail control is given. A control that fills its bounds was once stretched by this and would be again without notice.

## Where this lives

The taxonomy table above is the routing for tests. The runner and its supporting pieces are:

| Piece | Source |
|---|---|
| Assertion helpers and the failure type | [test.h](../src/test.h) |
| Shared fixtures, index building, the shared gazetteer, the null AV host | [test_fixtures.h](../src/test_fixtures.h), [test_fixtures.cpp](../src/test_fixtures.cpp) |
| Registration and the console runner | [test_runner.h](../src/test_runner.h), [test_runner.cpp](../src/test_runner.cpp) |
| The `/test`, `/test-temp:` and `/validate-po` entry points | [app_command_line.h](../src/app_command_line.h), [app_validate_po.cpp](../src/app_validate_po.cpp) |

Beyond the suite, `.\dd.ps1 test` also runs `tools/lint_repo.ps1`, which enforces the mechanically
checkable subset of [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) — platform containment, SQLite ownership, application
threads, frame accessors, and the integrity of every link and `src/` anchor in this documentation
set. `tools/lint_repo_selftest.ps1` applies this document's own standard to that lint: it breaks each
rule in turn and asserts the rule fires, so a lint rule cannot quietly stop matching and report PASS
forever.
