# Diffractor Product Design

This document owns durable user concepts and observable behavior. Specialized documents own the
details of collections, locations, zoom, selection controls, metadata, file I/O, and Movie
mixer. [Implementation](implementation.md) owns architecture; GitHub owns plans and issue status.

## Primary Design Drivers

1. **Fast, lightweight performance.** Start and respond quickly, scale to large collections, work
   progressively, and bound CPU, memory, storage, and network use.
2. **A clear user mental model.** Make scope, contents, command target, effect, and recovery
   predictable. Hidden targets and silent state changes are defects.

Neither driver overrides the other. Performance changes preserve behavior, and clearer workflows
must not introduce avoidable blocking or unbounded work.

## Product Promise

Diffractor is a private Windows organizer for photos, video, and audio on storage the user controls.
It finds, views, compares, describes, edits, and manages media without making its rebuildable index
the authority for user files or metadata.

## User Mental Model

Every user-visible interaction states four facts:

| Field | Closed values or meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Scope | Indexed collection, Folder, Recursive folder, External folder, Search, or justified All scopes |
| Contents | Query, filters, grouping, sorting, and visible/hidden counts |
| Target | Focused item, Singular displayed item, Complete visibly selected set, or Visible items |
| Effect | Action, affected count, destination/collisions, retained originals, and recovery |

`All scopes` is used only when behavior is provably identical in every concrete scope. Internal work
has no user scope or target. A behavior that cannot be expressed with this ontology requires product
clarification rather than a new alias or implicit state.

The target is always visible. Focus is the keyboard cursor and range anchor; selection is the
complete batch target; a displayed or pinned item does not silently enlarge it.

### Command Availability

A command is offered when its effect is visible on the current surface and its target qualifies.
Ineligible target commands retain a concrete disabled reason. A submenu reflects the eligibility of
its entries. A platform capability that does not exist is absent rather than permanently disabled.
Configured external tools in the Open menu declare a singular `{item-path}` invocation, so they are
offered only when exactly one file is selected. Multi-file selections omit those entries; association
handlers that accept the whole selected set remain available when the selection qualifies.

Commands affecting list contents or presentation belong to Items. Commands affecting rendered media
belong to Items and Fullscreen. Task commands belong to their task view. Keyboard, toolbar, menu,
context-menu, and accessibility entry points share the same eligibility, target, confirmation, and
effect.

## Vocabulary

- **Scope** supplies candidate items; a **query** narrows them; filters determine **visible items**.
- **Focus** is navigation state; **selection** is the complete visible batch target.
- **Pin** visibly holds one selected item while focus moves for comparison.
- **Preview** is non-committing presentation; **Analyze** computes a plan; **Run** executes the
  validated reviewed plan.
- **Presence** compares one file with collection membership and likely copies.
- **Relation** says why another collection item is connected: copy, album, series, capture time, or
  capture place.

### Naming Views, Modes, And Presentation Choices

Top-level views are Items, Fullscreen, Edit, Movie mixer, Tags, Locate, Rename, Convert, Metadata,
Date, Import, and Sync. “Media view” names the internal Fullscreen renderer, not another user view.

The user-entered modes are zoom mode and a running Slideshow. Inspect zoom is a gesture, not a mode.
Grouping, sorting, density, verbose metadata, and navigator display are presentation choices.
Singular, Comparison, and Selection summary are panel forms selected by the current selection.

## Application Structure

Items is the windowed browser: grouped thumbnails or details, optional media/metadata preview, and
independent list/preview scrolling. Fullscreen reuses the same logical scope, query, filters,
grouping, sorting, focus, selection, and media state. Leaving it restores Items without rebuilding
the browsing context.

Task views expose their parameters beside the work surface and return to Items on task Close. Edit,
Locate, Tags, and Metadata can show a selector strip containing only items the task can act on.
Fullscreen is unavailable from a task view because it would hide the task's target and controls.

The item list owns its filters, recursion, grouping, sorting, density, and size controls. Totals and
grouping are separate affordances. Optional query-specific rows are navigation/presentation only and
do not change grouping, sorting, focus, or selection. A captured control retains its value and
position while its result refresh is in flight.

Thumbnail rows share a height and preserve each image's aspect. A short trailing row remains short;
the layout does not crop images merely to fill width. Relayout preserves the focused visible item or
the content nearest the viewport center when possible.

The selection panel and responsive behavior are owned by [selection-controls.md](selection-controls.md).
Wheel and pinch routing are owned by [zoom.md](zoom.md#input).

## Navigation And Search

The address box accepts folders and indexed search terms for text, metadata, dates, locations, media
types, ratings, labels, tags, duplicates, comparisons, negation, and Boolean expressions.
When Diffractor writes a query back to text, literal operands are quoted whenever the tokenizer
would otherwise read their characters as syntax, and numeric operands preserve the predicate value
rather than a rounded display label unless the property is explicitly bucketed.

Address editing keeps a committed value, a typed draft, and an optional completion preview. Up/Down
preview completions without replacing the draft. Tab accepts into the draft; Enter commits; Escape
first restores the draft from a preview, then restores the address captured when editing began.

History entries retain query and selection. Back and Forward restore rather than rewrite them, and
move the history position only after the target navigation is accepted; a refused or unavailable
target leaves the current entry and the next Back/Forward target unchanged. Navigating after Back
removes the forward branch. Parent broadens one narrowing at a time. Sibling folder commands remain
at the same level and are unavailable at their ends.

Navigation from a map, chart, breakdown, summary, or group header changes the query only. Grouping,
sorting, and filters remain user-owned. Filtering removes hidden items from selection; removing the
filter does not reselect them.

## Selection And Viewing

Plain click selects one item; Ctrl toggles; Shift extends from the focus anchor; Ctrl+Shift combines
both. Empty-space clicks and empty selection rectangles leave selection unchanged. Right-clicking an
unselected item selects it before opening a batch-oriented menu. Select All targets visible items.

One selected media item previews, two compatible files compare, and other selections summarize.
Opening media preserves selection. Selection, focus, pin, hover, and errors remain visually distinct.

Play controls the displayed audio/video. Slideshow walks visible photo/video/audio items from the
focused item, holds photos for the configured delay, plays timed media to completion, and stops when
no eligible next item exists. Repeat controls sequence ends; normal continuation and Slideshow are
separate choices. Resume stores playback position in the rebuildable index and never changes media.

Video thumbnail preview is latest-wins, does not hydrate offline files, and may publish the last
successful frame as the versioned SQLite thumbnail.

## Collection Presence

Presence distinguishes direct membership from possible-copy evidence:

- **In collection** means this file path belongs to a collection folder.
- **Possible copy**, **Possible newer copy**, and **Possible older copy** compare an outside file with
  likely collection copies and state uncertainty explicitly.
- **Outside collection; no possible copy identified** is a completed absence of current evidence,
  not proof that no copy exists.
- **Checking presence** is incomplete work and cannot publish an absence result.

Presence supports browsing and import decisions. It never chooses a keeper, recommends deletion, or
adds a candidate to the command target. [Collections](collections.md) owns duplicate evidence parity.

## Related Items

Related items searches the indexed collection from one focused anchor and changes no files. Each
result appears under its strongest relation only, in this order: possible copy, same album, same
series, nearby capture time, nearby capture place. Each group is bounded and ordered by closeness.

Copy identity is shared with duplicate search and Presence. Re-encoded, resized, or rotated images
may match through perceptual evidence; crops, bursts sharing only a timestamp, and low-information
images are not asserted as copies. Related results never become targets automatically.

## Metadata, Editing, And Files

Metadata persists in media or sidecars; the index is a cache. [Metadata](metadata.md) owns format and
tag support, and [File I/O](file-io.md) owns write safety and read-back.

Edit holds photo adjustments as a draft. Save updates the file; Save As creates and opens a new file;
leaving a changed draft offers Save, Don’t Save, and Cancel. Reset changes only the draft.
If source pixels are still loading, unreadable, or refused as too large, Edit shows that bounded
state and withholds pixel operations rather than editing a placeholder.

Metadata and Tags operate on the complete visibly selected set. Optional metadata fields change only
when selected for the run. Date adjustment applies one shift while preserving relative offsets;
items without a known date receive the chosen start. Rotation changes selected originals and is
always reviewed for multiple items. Convert/Resize creates output and retains sources. Share hands
the complete visibly selected set to an app chosen in the system share sheet, or to an email draft
where the system has none. Files its options leave unchanged go as themselves; converted, resized,
or zipped copies are staged in a temporary folder and kept until the next share, because the
receiving app may read them later. Sources are never changed.

Collisions use Replace, Skip, Auto-rename, or Block Run. Two plan rows claiming one destination are
a collision. Delete distinguishes recoverable Recycle from confirmed Permanent delete. A location
without a usable recycle facility never presents permanent deletion as Recycle; when a requested
Recycle would instead destroy an item, Windows owns the mandatory permanent-delete confirmation
before that item is removed. If the user has enabled Windows' Recycle Bin delete confirmation,
Windows may also confirm ordinary recycles.

## Guided Operations

Import, Sync, Convert, Metadata, Date, and batch Rename follow one state grammar:

1. Scope and destination.
2. Complete visible target and count.
3. Options, collision policy, and recovery.
4. Analyze a snapshot.
5. Review actions, overwrites, skips, and permanent effects.
6. Revalidate and Run the approved snapshot.
7. Retain per-item Succeeded, Failed, Skipped, and Canceled results.

A finished run's status states what it did, then why any rows did nothing; a run that reports neither
leaves the review's status.

Changing scope, target, options, destination, or relevant files invalidates the analysis. Cancellation
stops future work and reports partial completion without claiming rollback. Import history is not
duplicate proof; Sync names both endpoints and direction. Convert carries the reviewed collision
decision through final publication: a destination that appears or changes after review is refused
rather than overwritten. Sync applies full-path collection exclusions to corresponding relative
folders on both compared trees.

## System States And Consistency

Surfaces distinguish loading, searching, empty folder, no results, filtered results, unavailable
scope, indexing, offline, download required, unsupported, and decode failed. Each state names its
scope and next action; blank content is not an error message.

Long work shows operation, current item, completed/total counts, and Cancel. The taskbar button shows
the same progress, and flashes when work ends while another application is in front. Results and
actionable errors remain afterward. Progressive results apply only to the requesting scope and
generation. Visible state converges after source changes without unrelated input. [Implementation](implementation.md#view-invalidation)
owns the invalidation ordering.

Animation carries no meaning and completes immediately in software rendering or when the system
disables client-area animation. Durable preferences persist; transient focus, selection, pin, zoom,
and operation progress do not.

Unattended indexing skips media attributed to a prior crash for the current release line; an explicit
user open is still attempted. Repeated unsettled launches reset presentation and disable hardware
acceleration while retaining collection and user data.

Network capabilities independently disclose trigger, transmitted data, recipient, purpose, and
disable control. Aggregate feature-use diagnostics contain no stable user ID or file information.
