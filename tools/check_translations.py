"""Validate Diffractor translations end to end.

This runs two phases:

  * **Phase 1 - app_text registration** (formerly ``check_app_text.py``): every
    ``text_t`` / ``plural_text`` member declared in ``src/app_text.h`` must be
    registered exactly once, in the correct vector, in ``src/app_text.cpp``. A
    broken registration is always fatal.
  * **Phase 2 - translation (.po) consistency**: read all of
    ``exe/languages/*.po`` and build a per-string view across every language so
    the translations can be reviewed for consistency. It is meant to give a
    human (or an agent) an easy way to spot:

  * untranslated / absent strings - a source string that exists in the union of
    all ``.po`` files but is empty or missing in one or more languages;
  * placeholder mismatches - anonymous ``{}`` are substituted positionally, so
    the *count* must match the source exactly: dropping one shifts every later
    value and leaves the last one unfilled. Named tokens such as ``{count}`` or
    ``{first-name}`` are substituted by name, so only their presence is checked
    and repeating one is legitimate. (The *order* of anonymous ``{}`` cannot be
    validated - they are textually identical, so a translation that swaps two
    values is indistinguishable from a correct one. That stays a review
    question.)
  * accelerator mismatches - a ``&`` that begins a word in the English source is
    a Win32 mnemonic marker (``&OK``, ``As &JPEG``), because dialog buttons are
    real Win32 controls. A translation may move the marker to a different
    letter, but must keep exactly one and must not leave it dangling. A ``&``
    surrounded by spaces or inside a word is literal text (``Fitness &
    Workout``, ``R&B``) and translations may render it as the local "and".
  * quality mismatches in existing translations - objective, language-agnostic
    structural differences between a source string and its translation: leading
    or trailing whitespace (matters because several strings are concatenated in
    the UI), embedded newline count, a dropped trailing colon, or a dropped
    sentence-ending ``.``/``?``/``!`` (the last is skipped for CJK text, where
    omitting the period on labels is the normal convention);
    * extra plural-form tokens - Slavic languages (Czech, Polish, Russian,
        Ukrainian) declare additional forms at index 2 and above (``msgstr[2]``,
        ``msgstr[3]``). ``load_po`` parses them and the app selects them at runtime
        for the relevant counts, so the report only flags an extra form whose
        placeholder tokens are not present in the singular or plural source.

The English source text *is* the ``msgid`` in each ``.po`` file (Diffractor's
``gen_po`` test generates the msgids from the in-code strings), so the union of
all msgids is used as the reference set of source strings.

Usage (from the repo root, using the project virtual environment)::

    tools\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe tools\\check_translations.py

A full Markdown report grouped by source string is written to
``tmp/translation_report.md`` and a summary plus the list of problems is printed
to stdout. Pass ``--full`` to also dump every string to stdout.

Exit code: non-zero when phase 1 finds a registration error or phase 2 finds a
placeholder or accelerator mismatch (all real bugs). Untranslated, quality and
extra plural-form issues are reported as warnings and only fail the run under
``--strict`` (many languages are intentionally incomplete).

The parser is intentionally self-contained (no third-party dependency) and
tolerant in the same way Diffractor's own ``load_po`` is - e.g. it accepts the
stray trailing semicolons present in some ``.po`` files.
