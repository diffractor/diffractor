.SYNOPSIS
    Self-test for tools/lint_repo.ps1: proves each rule can actually fail.

.DESCRIPTION
    docs/testing.md: "A test that cannot fail is worse than no test." That applies to the lint
    itself -- a rule whose regex silently stopped matching would report PASS forever and quietly
    stop guarding its boundary.

    Each case appends a deliberate violation to a real file, runs the lint, asserts the matching
    rule reported FAIL, then restores the file byte for byte. Restoring by bytes matters: the
    source files carry a UTF-8 BOM, and a text-mode rewrite drops it.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -File tools/lint_repo_selftest.ps1
