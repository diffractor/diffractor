// Purpose: Face input reduction, alignment, vectors, resemblance groups, and the sample face that
// identifies one. Owned by docs/faces.md. Nothing here reads a file, touches the database, or needs
// a window; the detector and the embedding model live behind face_engine, which no build in this
// release supplies. The feature that uses this lives on the face-search branch.
