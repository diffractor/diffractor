// Purpose: Geometry and material shared by the sidebar's software-rendered charts - the file-type
// pie and the history calendar. The rasterisers declared here are implemented in render_charts.cpp.
//
// The globe is not merely round, it is lit: render_globe.cpp shades every pixel from one fixed
// light and darkens toward the limb, so it reads as a solid object. A flat disc and a flat heat
// grid beside it read as diagrams of one. These charts therefore borrow the globe's light vector
// and its shading ramp rather than inventing their own, because what makes the three look like one
// panel is the shared material, not the extrusion.
//
// Every rasteriser writes two answers: the pixels, and a 1x buffer naming what each pixel shows.
// Hit testing reads that buffer. Once a chart is tilted and extruded, no rect or angle recomputed
// afterwards agrees with the silhouette the user is aiming at - the wedge under the pointer is not
// the wedge atan2 names, and a block that has risen no longer fills its cell. design.md targeting
// asks that the pointer be ON the thing it selects, and an identity buffer is the only cheap way
// to mean that exactly.
