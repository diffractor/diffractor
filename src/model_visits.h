// Purpose: locations.md 6 -- derives visit nodes from a result set. A visit is a run of items
// close together in space whose gaps in time are all short, which is the shape of a trip. The
// input is a vector of detached samples taken on the UI thread and the output is a vector of
// detached nodes, so the whole computation runs on a worker and owns nothing the UI owns.
